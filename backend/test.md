ere are high‑impact improvements and feature ideas tailored to your codebase and current issues.

Immediate improvements (fix pain points first)
[analysis reliability] Add robust timeouts/retries and cancellation for the analysis request in 
src/components/Ques_res.jsx
. Show progress UI and handle slow Flask/A.I. responses gracefully.
[backend timeouts + IDs] In 
backend/server.js
 and Flask 
backend/app.py
:
Set upstream timeout to Flask with abort/cleanup.
Generate a requestId and store status in DB (pending, running, done, failed) in AnalysisResult.
Return 202 Accepted with requestId; add polling endpoint GET /analysis/:id/status.
[auth guards everywhere] You’ve guarded /profile/* in 
src/pages/profile/Layout.jsx
. Also guard /test and /test/questions to avoid leaking state after logout.
UX/UI enhancements
[profile polish] Add avatar upload, cover banner, and quick stats on 
Overview.jsx
. Add “Change Password” and “Delete Account” sections under /profile/edit.
[skeletons + toasts] Add loading skeleton components across 
Overview.jsx
, 
History.jsx
, and 
Ques_res.jsx
. Use your existing Sonner toasts for analysis lifecycle (queued/running/success/failure).
[onboarding] First‑time users get a short guided tour (intro modal) and a quick setup for groupType and preferences.
Career features
[save/bookmark careers] Allow users to “Save” recommendations from 
Ques_res.jsx
, stored in DB and visible under /profile/history or /profile/saved.
[compare over time] Show a comparison view of two assessments to visualize changes.
[export & share] Export assessment as PDF/PNG; optional email report.
[career detail pages] Dedicated page per career with responsibilities, required skills, courses, colleges, salary ranges.
[learning path] Recommend skills and curated resources (YouTube, MOOCs) for each career; track progress.
Data and personalization
[institutions + scholarships] Match colleges/courses and scholarships based on preferences (country/state/district) already present on the user object.
[salary & trends] Pull median salaries and job outlook (by region) and display on the career cards.
[localization] Prepare i18n scaffolding for future languages.
Platform & performance
[PWA + offline] Make it installable; cache static assets and user’s last results for offline view.
[TypeScript migration] Gradually type key files (
context/AuthContext.jsx
, 
components/Ques_res.jsx
) and API layer with zod validation for responses.
[error boundary] Add a global React ErrorBoundary to catch render crashes and report them.
[react-query usage] You already have React Query. Migrate fetches in 
AuthContext.jsx
 and history fetch into query hooks with caching and auto‑refresh.
[env config] Centralize API URLs and timeouts. Ensure PYTHON_API_URL and JWT_SECRET are set via .env.
Backend/ops
[task queue] For long analysis: push to Celery/RQ with Redis; frontend polls status. Prevents “Step is still running” hangs.
[logging/metrics] Add request logging with IDs, and error tracking (Sentry) in both Node and Flask. Add latency metrics to spot bottlenecks.
[rate limiting] Basic rate limits on analyze endpoints to avoid abuse.
[pagination] Add pagination to GET /user/analysis-results and GET /careers (future).
Security
[2FA + OAuth] Optional 2FA; add Google login. Email verification on signup.
[session hardening] Short‑lived tokens with refresh flow; revoke tokens on password change.
[privacy] Data export/delete account to support GDPR-like flows.
Testing
[unit + e2e] Jest for components and utility functions; Cypress/Playwright for flows (login → test → analysis → history).
Suggested next 3 tasks to implement
Stabilize analysis flow (queue + polling): requestId, status endpoints, frontend polling with timeout and cancel.
Save/bookmark careers: button in 
Ques_res.jsx
, backend endpoints, “Saved” list in Profile.
Password/Account management: add change password and delete account on /profile/edit.
